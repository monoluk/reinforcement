Assignment 3

This assignmnent is the implementation of the MDP and qLearning. The procedures given in the homeword instructions are very detailed and useful. 
It basically set the tone of how the program should be implemented.

Major formula used 
\(w_i \leftarrow w_i + \alpha \cdot difference \cdot f_i(s,a) \)
\( difference = (r + \gamma \max\limits_{a'} Q(s', a')) - Q(s,a) \)
\(Q(s,a) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n f_i(s,a) w_i \)
